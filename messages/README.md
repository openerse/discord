# Messages

"Messages" refers to all text in different formats that is used statically, that is, that does not have extremely important changes over a long period of time.

## Format

A message is stored in different formats: plain text, JSON, and Markdown.

The names of these files also have a predefined format:

| File format | File name format |
| :---: | :---: |
| Plain Text  | `[Message name]_[Language].txt` |
| JSON  | `[Message name]_[Language].json`  |
| Markdown  | `[Message name]_[Language].md`  |

The JSON format must be a backup for [discohook](https://discohook.org/).

Absolutely all messages must go in a folder.
